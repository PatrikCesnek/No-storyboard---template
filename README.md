# No-storyboard---template
App template without storyboard

When you are creating iOS apps without usage of storyboard - programmatic UI, it is annoying to have to do the same thing over and over again. This way all you need to do is to clone this repository and you'll start with project without storyboard with all the necesarry code and white background - which you can change for your needs.

This is version for iOS 13
